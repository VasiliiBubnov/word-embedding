# word-embedding
Here we host code that works with word embedding and performs clustering using the Kohonen network. Word embedding is a form of representing words and documents using a dense vector representation that captures a wealth of information about the context and semantic meaning of words. It's a crucial element of modern natural language processing (NLP) systems, facilitating superior performance in tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation. On the other hand, the Kohonen network, also known as Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), is an unsupervised learning method used for clustering and visualization, capturing topological features of the input data, thereby providing a powerful tool for understanding complex high-dimensional data.
